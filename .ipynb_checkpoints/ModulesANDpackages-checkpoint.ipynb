    "## 1. Creating and Using a Hierarchical Package of Modules\n",
    "1. **Create the package structure:**\n",
    "   - On your local filesystem, create the following directory structure:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     graphics/\n",
    "         __init__.py\n",
    "         primitive/\n",
    "             __init__.py\n",
    "             line.py\n",
    "             fill.py\n",
    "             text.py\n",
    "         formats/\n",
    "             __init__.py\n",
    "             png.py\n",
    "             jpg.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write code in the modules:**\n",
    "   - Inside `line.py`, write a function `draw_line()` that prints \"Drawing a line\".\n",
    "   - Inside `fill.py`, write a function `fill_shape()` that prints \"Filling a shape\".\n",
    "   - Inside `text.py`, write a function `draw_text()` that prints \"Drawing text\".\n",
    "   - Inside `png.py`, write a function `save_as_png()` that prints \"Saving as PNG\".\n",
    "   - Inside `jpg.py`, write a function `save_as_jpg()` that prints \"Saving as JPG\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - In a Jupyter notebook, perform the following imports:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import graphics.primitive.line\n",
    "     from graphics.primitive import fill\n",
    "     import graphics.formats.jpg as jpg\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Call the functions from these modules to demonstrate the imports work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional enhancement:**\n",
    "   - Modify the `__init__.py` files to automatically import the modules inside them, so that when you import the package, the modules are already available without needing additional import statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directory structure example:**\n",
    "   - Ensure your directory structure looks like this:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     graphics/\n",
    "         __init__.py\n",
    "         primitive/\n",
    "             __init__.py\n",
    "             line.py\n",
    "             fill.py\n",
    "             text.py\n",
    "         formats/\n",
    "             __init__.py\n",
    "             png.py\n",
    "             jpg.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Content of the Python files:**\n",
    "   - `line.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def draw_line():\n",
    "         print(\"Drawing a line\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - `fill.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def fill_shape():\n",
    "         print(\"Filling a shape\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - `text.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def draw_text():\n",
    "         print(\"Drawing text\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - `png.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def save_as_png():\n",
    "         print(\"Saving as PNG\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - `jpg.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def save_as_jpg():\n",
    "         print(\"Saving as JPG\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Jupyter Notebook example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In your notebook, create the following cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import graphics.primitive.line\n",
    "     from graphics.primitive import fill\n",
    "     import graphics.formats.jpg as jpg\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Calling the functions\n",
    "     graphics.primitive.line.draw_line()\n",
    "     fill.fill_shape()\n",
    "     jpg.save_as_jpg()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional enhancement:**\n",
    "   - Modify the `__init__.py` files in the `primitive` and `formats` directories as follows:\n",
    "     - `graphics/primitive/__init__.py`:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       from .line import draw_line\n",
    "       from .fill import fill_shape\n",
    "       from .text import draw_text\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - `graphics/formats/__init__.py`:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       from .png import save_as_png\n",
    "       from .jpg import save_as_jpg\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Now, in your Jupyter notebook, you can directly import the `graphics` package and call the functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "     graphics.draw_line()\n",
    "     graphics.fill_shape()\n",
    "     graphics.save_as_jpg()\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "### **2. Splitting a Module into Multiple Files**\n",
    "To apply the concept of splitting a module into multiple files while keeping them unified as a single logical module, you can follow these steps in the context of your \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" game. We'll split the game into multiple files (e.g., for handling the game logic, the user input, and so on) and then unify them in a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating a directory named `rock_paper_scissors` to replace the existing `rock_paper_scissors.py` file. The structure will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rock_paper_scissors/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    game_logic.py\n",
    "    user_input.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Move Code into Separate Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's split the code into the `game_logic.py` and `user_input.py` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `game_logic.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This file will contain the logic for determining the winner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# rock_paper_scissors/game_logic.py\n",
    "\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "def play(user_choice):\n",
    "    computer = random.choice(['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'])\n",
    "\n",
    "    if user_choice == computer:\n",
    "        return f\"Both chose {user_choice}. It's a tie!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    if is_win(user_choice, computer):\n",
    "        return f\"User wins! {user_choice} beats {computer}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    return f\"Computer wins! {computer} beats {user_choice}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def is_win(player, opponent):\n",
    "    return (player == 'rock' and opponent == 'scissors') or \\\n",
    "           (player == 'scissors' and opponent == 'paper') or \\\n",
    "           (player == 'paper' and opponent == 'rock')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `user_input.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This file will handle getting the input from the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# rock_paper_scissors/user_input.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_user_choice():\n",
    "    return input(\"Choose rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Glue Everything Together in `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll use the `__init__.py` file to unify these separate files into a single logical module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# rock_paper_scissors/__init__.py\n",
    "\n",
    "from .game_logic import play\n",
    "from .user_input import get_user_choice\n",
    "\n",
    "__all__ = ['play', 'get_user_choice']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `__init__.py` file ensures that when the `rock_paper_scissors` module is imported, the `play` function and `get_user_choice` function are accessible directly, as if they were in a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Using the Unified Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the module is split into multiple files but unified through `__init__.py`, you can use it in the same way as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import rock_paper_scissors as rps\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    user_choice = rps.get_user_choice()\n",
    "    result = rps.play(user_choice)\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`game_logic.py`**: Contains the core logic for the game, such as deciding the winner.\n",
    "- **`user_input.py`**: Handles user interaction, such as collecting the user's choice.\n",
    "- **`__init__.py`**: This file ties together the different parts of the module, making it possible to import everything as if it were still a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: The code is cleaner and more maintainable by separating concerns into different files.\n",
    "- **Unification**: Users of the module can still import everything they need using a single `import rock_paper_scissors` statement.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: You can easily add more files (e.g., for additional game modes or features) without breaking existing code.\n"

    "### **4. Reloading Modules**\n",
    "To reload modules in your game project during development, you can use the `importlib.reload()` function in Python, which is more modern and recommended over the older `imp.reload()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can apply it to your game module:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import `importlib` and Reload Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working on the `rock_paper_scissors` game module, for example, and you've made changes to the code, you can reload the module in your interactive session or development script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import importlib\n",
    "import rock_paper_scissors.game_logic as game_logic\n",
    "import rock_paper_scissors.user_input as user_input\n",
    "\n",
    "# After making changes to the code in these modules, you can reload them like this:\n",
    "importlib.reload(game_logic)\n",
    "importlib.reload(user_input)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, you can use the reloaded functions\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    user_choice = user_input.get_user_choice()\n",
    "    result = game_logic.play(user_choice)\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import `importlib`:** First, import the `importlib` module, which provides the `reload()` function.\n",
    "2. **Reloading the Modules:** After making changes to the source code of `game_logic.py` or `user_input.py`, use `importlib.reload()` to reload those modules. This allows you to apply and test your changes without restarting the Python interpreter.\n",
    "3. **Using the Reloaded Functions:** Once the modules are reloaded, you can use the updated functions in your game without needing to re-import them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reloading Limitations:** Just as in your provided text, be cautious when using `reload()` in a production environment. Reloading can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if objects, classes, or functions from the module were already imported or instantiated. It’s best to use this during development and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, if you’re working in an interactive environment like a Jupyter Notebook or a Python shell, you can reload your game modules after every change. This is particularly useful when you’re making iterative changes and want to see the effects immediately without restarting your entire environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in an Interactive Session:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Python Shell or Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run your game:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import rock_paper_scissors.game_logic as game_logic\n",
    "   import rock_paper_scissors.user_input as user_input\n",
    "   \n",
    "   def run_game():\n",
    "       user_choice = user_input.get_user_choice()\n",
    "       result = game_logic.play(user_choice)\n",
    "       print(result)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   run_game()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make Changes to the `game_logic` or `user_input` Module:**\n",
    "   - Edit your `rock_paper_scissors/game_logic.py` or `rock_paper_scissors/user_input.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reload the Modules and Test Again:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import importlib\n",
    "   importlib.reload(game_logic)\n",
    "   importlib.reload(user_input)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   run_game()  # Run the game with the reloaded code\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By reloading the modules, you can immediately test the changes in your game logic, making your development process more efficient."

    "# 5. **Making a Directory or Zip File Runnable As a Main Script**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Packaging the Application as a ZIP File\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to distribute your application as a ZIP file, you can bundle all the files together into a single ZIP archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a ZIP Archive:**\n",
    "\n",

    "   cd mygame/\n",
    "   zip -r mygame.zip .\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3 mygame.zip\n",

    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Optional - Creating a Shell Script for Easier Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to make it even easier for users to run your application, you can create a small shell script that wraps the command to run the ZIP file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, create a script named `run_mygame.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",

    "# **Adding Directories to sys.path** \n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: Using the `PYTHONPATH` Environment Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable allows you to specify additional directories that Python should add to `sys.path` when starting the interpreter. This method is useful when you want to set up the environment without modifying the code itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set `PYTHONPATH` Temporarily:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable temporarily when running your script. Here’s how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   export PYTHONPATH=\"/path/to/your/directory:/another/path\"\n",
    "   python3 /path/to/your/script.py\n",

    "   - Replace `\"/path/to/your/script.py\"` with the path to your Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set `PYTHONPATH` Permanently:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you want the directory to be included in `sys.path` every time you run Python, you can add the `PYTHONPATH` setting to your shell’s configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`).\n",

    "A `.pth` file is a simple text file that contains paths to directories you want to add to `sys.path`. This method is more permanent and can be used to ensure that your directories are always available.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Locate the `site-packages` Directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   First, locate the `site-packages` directory where you’ll place the `.pth` file. You can find it by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import site\n",
    "   print(site.getsitepackages())\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This will print the paths to the `site-packages` directories used by your Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a `.pth` File:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the `site-packages` directory, create a new `.pth` file. The name can be anything, but it must have the `.pth` extension (e.g., `myapp.pth`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Create a file named `myapp.pth` in the `site-packages` directory with the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   /home/shailendra/Documents/Teaching/Problem_solving/project&Assignment/Lecture7/games/classic\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify the Path Addition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   After placing the `.pth` file, you can verify that the directory has been added to `sys.path` by running the following in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import sys\n",
    "   print(sys.path)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You should see the path listed in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 3: Adding Path in Code (Use Sparingly)\n",
    "\n",
    "While it's usually better to avoid hardcoding paths in your code, there may be situations where you want to add a directory to `sys.path` programmatically. Here’s how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add the directory to sys.path\n",
    "sys.path.insert(0, \"/home/shailendra/Documents/Teaching/Problem_solving/project&Assignment/Lecture7/games\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now you can import your modules\n",
    "import rock_paper_scissor.game_logic as game_logic\n",
    "import rock_paper_scissor.user_input as user_input\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporary Path Addition**: Use `PYTHONPATH` when you need to add directories temporarily without altering code.\n",
    "- **Permanent Path Addition**: Use `.pth` files for a more permanent solution that doesn’t require modifying code.\n",
    "- **Code-Based Path Addition**: Use this approach sparingly, typically for development or specific cases where you need dynamic path adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has its use cases, so choose the one that best fits your needs."

    "# **Importing Modules Using a Name Given in a String Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import the `importlib` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import importlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Use `importlib.import_module()` to Import a Module by Name\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a string containing the name of a module you want to import:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "module_name = 'rock_paper_scissor.game_logic'\n",
    "module = importlib.import_module(module_name)\n",

    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic Module Import**: The function `dynamic_import()` attempts to import a module using the name provided as a string. If the module is successfully imported, it is returned and can be used like any other imported module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Import Errors**: If the module name provided is incorrect or the module cannot be found, the `ImportError` exception is caught, and a message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configurable Systems**: When module names are stored in configuration files or databases, and you want to import them dynamically based on those names.\n",
    "- **Plugin Systems**: Where you might want to load different plugins (modules) based on user input or some runtime condition.\n",
    "- **Flexible Imports**: When you need to import different modules depending on the runtime environment or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach gives you the flexibility to import modules based on strings, allowing for more dynamic and flexible Python applications."

    "Creating a virtual environment is a great way to isolate your Python projects and manage dependencies separately from your system-wide Python installation. This is especially useful when developing a game or any application where you want to control the specific packages and versions you’re using.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a New Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a new virtual environment using the `venv` module, which is included with Python 3. Here’s how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to your project directory** (if you haven't created one, you can do it now):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir my_game_project\n",
    "   cd my_game_project\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create the virtual environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3 -m venv myenv   ##python3 -m venv gameenv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command creates a new directory named `myenv`, which contains a copy of the Python interpreter and a clean environment for installing packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using the virtual environment, you need to activate it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **On macOS/Linux:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  source myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **On Windows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once activated, your command prompt will change to indicate that you are now working inside the virtual environment. For example, it might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(myenv) user@machine:~/my_game_project$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Install Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your virtual environment is active, you can install the packages you need. For your game, you might want to install the necessary dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install some_dependency another_dependency\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you need `pygame` for game development:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pygame\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Install Your Game Module\n",
    "\n",
    "If your game is structured as a package, you can install it in the virtual environment as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Navigate to the directory containing your `setup.py`** (if you have one) or where your game module is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install the game module**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install -e .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `-e` flag stands for \"editable,\" which means that changes to your code will automatically be reflected in the installation without needing to reinstall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Running Your Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your environment is set up and your game is installed, you can run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python path_to_your_game_main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your main script is `main.py` in the project root:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python main.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Deactivate the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’re done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by simply typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return your command prompt to the system’s default Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Distribute Your Game\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to distribute your game, you can package it up and share it with others. They can install it in their own virtual environments using `pip` or any other package management tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a virtual environment** using `python3 -m venv myenv`.\n",
    "2. **Activate the virtual environment** with `source myenv/bin/activate` (on macOS/Linux) or `myenv\\Scripts\\activate` (on Windows).\n",
    "3. **Install dependencies** and your game module within the environment.\n",
    "4. **Run your game** using `python main.py`.\n",
    "5. **Deactivate the virtual environment** when you’re done with `deactivate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures that your game and its dependencies are isolated from other Python projects, preventing conflicts and making it easier to manage."
