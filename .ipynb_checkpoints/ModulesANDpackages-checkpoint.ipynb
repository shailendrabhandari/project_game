    "# 1. Creating and Using a Hierarchical Package of Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to create a simple hierarchical package structure, explore how to organize modules, and practice importing them in a Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task:\n",
    "1. **Create the Package Structure:**\n",
    "   - On your local filesystem, create the following directory structure:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     graphics/\n",
    "         __init__.py\n",
    "         primitive/\n",
    "             __init__.py\n",
    "             line.py\n",
    "             fill.py\n",
    "             text.py\n",
    "         formats/\n",
    "             __init__.py\n",
    "             png.py\n",
    "             jpg.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write Code in the Modules:**\n",
    "   - Inside `line.py`, write a function `draw_line()` that prints \"Drawing a line\".\n",
    "   - Inside `fill.py`, write a function `fill_shape()` that prints \"Filling a shape\".\n",
    "   - Inside `text.py`, write a function `draw_text()` that prints \"Drawing text\".\n",
    "   - Inside `png.py`, write a function `save_as_png()` that prints \"Saving as PNG\".\n",
    "   - Inside `jpg.py`, write a function `save_as_jpg()` that prints \"Saving as JPG\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "   - In a Jupyter notebook, perform the following imports:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import graphics.primitive.line\n",
    "     from graphics.primitive import fill\n",
    "     import graphics.formats.jpg as jpg\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Call the functions from these modules to demonstrate the imports work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional Enhancement:**\n",
    "   - Modify the `__init__.py` files to automatically import the modules inside them, so that when you import the package, the modules are already available without needing additional import statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directory Structure Example:**\n",
    "   - Ensure your directory structure looks like this:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     graphics/\n",
    "         __init__.py\n",
    "         primitive/\n",
    "             __init__.py\n",
    "             line.py\n",
    "             fill.py\n",
    "             text.py\n",
    "         formats/\n",
    "             __init__.py\n",
    "             png.py\n",
    "             jpg.py\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Content of the Python Files:**\n",
    "   - `line.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def draw_line():\n",
    "         print(\"Drawing a line\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - `fill.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def fill_shape():\n",
    "         print(\"Filling a shape\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - `text.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def draw_text():\n",
    "         print(\"Drawing text\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - `png.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def save_as_png():\n",
    "         print(\"Saving as PNG\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - `jpg.py`:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def save_as_jpg():\n",
    "         print(\"Saving as JPG\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Jupyter Notebook Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In your notebook, create the following cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import graphics.primitive.line\n",
    "     from graphics.primitive import fill\n",
    "     import graphics.formats.jpg as jpg\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Calling the functions\n",
    "     graphics.primitive.line.draw_line()\n",
    "     fill.fill_shape()\n",
    "     jpg.save_as_jpg()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optional Enhancement:**\n",
    "   - Modify the `__init__.py` files in the `primitive` and `formats` directories as follows:\n",
    "     - `graphics/primitive/__init__.py`:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       from .line import draw_line\n",
    "       from .fill import fill_shape\n",
    "       from .text import draw_text\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - `graphics/formats/__init__.py`:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       from .png import save_as_png\n",
    "       from .jpg import save_as_jpg\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Now, in your Jupyter notebook, you can directly import the `graphics` package and call the functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "     graphics.draw_line()\n",
    "     graphics.fill_shape()\n",
    "     graphics.save_as_jpg()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n"

    "# Step 4: Explanation of the Games\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rock, Paper, Scissors (`rock_paper_scissors.py`)**:\n",
    "   - The user selects either rock, paper, or scissors.\n",
    "   - The computer randomly selects one of these options.\n",
    "   - The winner is determined based on traditional game rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Guess the Number (`guess_the_number.py`)**:\n",
    "   - The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10.\n",
    "   - The user must guess the number, receiving feedback if their guess is too high or too low, until they guess correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tic-Tac-Toe (`tic_tac_toe.py`)**:\n",
    "   - The user plays against the computer in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.\n",
    "   - The board is displayed after each move, and the game ends when there is a winner or a tie.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows you to easily add more games in the future by following the same pattern. Each game is contained in its own module, making it easy to manage and extend."

    "# 2. Splitting a Module into Multiple Files\n",
    "To apply the concept of splitting a module into multiple files while keeping them unified as a single logical module, you can follow these steps in the context of your \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" game. We'll split the game into multiple files (e.g., for handling the game logic, the user input, and so on) and then unify them in a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating a directory named `rock_paper_scissors` to replace the existing `rock_paper_scissors.py` file. The structure will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "rock_paper_scissors/\n",
    "    __init__.py\n",
    "    game_logic.py\n",
    "    user_input.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Move Code into Separate Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's split the code into the `game_logic.py` and `user_input.py` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `game_logic.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This file will contain the logic for determining the winner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# rock_paper_scissors/game_logic.py\n",
    "\n",
    "import random\n",
    "\n",
    "def play(user_choice):\n",
    "    computer = random.choice(['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'])\n",
    "\n",
    "    if user_choice == computer:\n",
    "        return f\"Both chose {user_choice}. It's a tie!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    if is_win(user_choice, computer):\n",
    "        return f\"User wins! {user_choice} beats {computer}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    return f\"Computer wins! {computer} beats {user_choice}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def is_win(player, opponent):\n",
    "    return (player == 'rock' and opponent == 'scissors') or \\\n",
    "           (player == 'scissors' and opponent == 'paper') or \\\n",
    "           (player == 'paper' and opponent == 'rock')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `user_input.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This file will handle getting the input from the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# rock_paper_scissors/user_input.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_user_choice():\n",
    "    return input(\"Choose rock, paper, or scissors: \").lower()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Glue Everything Together in `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll use the `__init__.py` file to unify these separate files into a single logical module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__init__.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# rock_paper_scissors/__init__.py\n",
    "\n",
    "from .game_logic import play\n",
    "from .user_input import get_user_choice\n",
    "\n",
    "__all__ = ['play', 'get_user_choice']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This `__init__.py` file ensures that when the `rock_paper_scissors` module is imported, the `play` function and `get_user_choice` function are accessible directly, as if they were in a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Using the Unified Module\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the module is split into multiple files but unified through `__init__.py`, you can use it in the same way as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import rock_paper_scissors as rps\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    user_choice = rps.get_user_choice()\n",
    "    result = rps.play(user_choice)\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`game_logic.py`**: Contains the core logic for the game, such as deciding the winner.\n",
    "- **`user_input.py`**: Handles user interaction, such as collecting the user's choice.\n",
    "- **`__init__.py`**: This file ties together the different parts of the module, making it possible to import everything as if it were still a single file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: The code is cleaner and more maintainable by separating concerns into different files.\n",
    "- **Unification**: Users of the module can still import everything they need using a single `import rock_paper_scissors` statement.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: You can easily add more files (e.g., for additional game modes or features) without breaking existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to maintain a logical and organized structure while providing a seamless interface to users of your module."

    "# 4. Reloading Modules\n",
    "To reload modules in your game project during development, you can use the `importlib.reload()` function in Python, which is more modern and recommended over the older `imp.reload()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can apply it to your game module:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Import `importlib` and Reload Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working on the `rock_paper_scissors` game module, for example, and you've made changes to the code, you can reload the module in your interactive session or development script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import importlib\n",
    "import rock_paper_scissors.game_logic as game_logic\n",
    "import rock_paper_scissors.user_input as user_input\n",
    "\n",
    "# After making changes to the code in these modules, you can reload them like this:\n",
    "importlib.reload(game_logic)\n",
    "importlib.reload(user_input)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, you can use the reloaded functions\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    user_choice = user_input.get_user_choice()\n",
    "    result = game_logic.play(user_choice)\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import `importlib`:** First, import the `importlib` module, which provides the `reload()` function.\n",
    "2. **Reloading the Modules:** After making changes to the source code of `game_logic.py` or `user_input.py`, use `importlib.reload()` to reload those modules. This allows you to apply and test your changes without restarting the Python interpreter.\n",
    "3. **Using the Reloaded Functions:** Once the modules are reloaded, you can use the updated functions in your game without needing to re-import them manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reloading Limitations:** Just as in your provided text, be cautious when using `reload()` in a production environment. Reloading can lead to unexpected behavior, especially if objects, classes, or functions from the module were already imported or instantiated. Itâ€™s best to use this during development and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, if youâ€™re working in an interactive environment like a Jupyter Notebook or a Python shell, you can reload your game modules after every change. This is particularly useful when youâ€™re making iterative changes and want to see the effects immediately without restarting your entire environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in an Interactive Session:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Python Shell or Jupyter Notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run your game:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import rock_paper_scissors.game_logic as game_logic\n",
    "   import rock_paper_scissors.user_input as user_input\n",
    "   \n",
    "   def run_game():\n",
    "       user_choice = user_input.get_user_choice()\n",
    "       result = game_logic.play(user_choice)\n",
    "       print(result)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   run_game()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Make Changes to the `game_logic` or `user_input` Module:**\n",
    "   - Edit your `rock_paper_scissors/game_logic.py` or `rock_paper_scissors/user_input.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reload the Modules and Test Again:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import importlib\n",
    "   importlib.reload(game_logic)\n",
    "   importlib.reload(user_input)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   run_game()  # Run the game with the reloaded code\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By reloading the modules, you can immediately test the changes in your game logic, making your development process more efficient."

    "# Making a Directory or Zip File Runnable As a Main Script\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Packaging the Application as a ZIP File\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to distribute your application as a ZIP file, you can bundle all the files together into a single ZIP archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a ZIP Archive:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd mygame/\n",
    "   zip -r mygame.zip .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This command will create a `mygame.zip` file containing all the files in the `mygame/` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the ZIP File as a Script:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can now execute the ZIP file directly using Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3 mygame.zip\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Just like running the directory, this will execute the `__main__.py` file inside the ZIP archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Optional - Creating a Shell Script for Easier Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to make it even easier for users to run your application, you can create a small shell script that wraps the command to run the ZIP file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, create a script named `run_mygame.sh`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "python3 /path/to/mygame.zip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to give the script execute permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chmod +x run_mygame.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now users can simply run the `run_mygame.sh` script to start the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "By organizing your code into a directory with a `__main__.py` file, you can make the entire directory or a ZIP file runnable as a script. This approach is particularly useful for distributing small to medium-sized Python applications that are not intended to be installed as packages but rather run directly."
